heed of their words But Curufin being filled with 
shame and malice took the bow of Celegorm and shot 
back as they went and the arrow was aimed at Luthien 
Huan leaping caught it in his mouth but Curufin shot 
again and Beren sprang before Luthien and the dart 
smote him in the 
breast
It is told that Huan pursued the sons of Feanor and 
they fled in fear and returning he brought to Luthien 
a herb out of the forest With that leaf he staunched 
Berens wound and by her arts and by her love she 
healed him and thus at last they returned to Doriath 
There Beren being torn between his oath and his love 
and knowing Luthien to be now safe arose one morning 
before the sun and committed her to the care of Huan 
then in great anguish he departed while she yet slept 
upon the 
grass
He rode northward again with all speed to the Pass of 
Sirion and coming to the skirts of TaurnuFuin he 
looked out across the waste of Anfauglith and saw afar 
the peaks of Thangorodrim There he dismissed the horse 
of Curufin and bade it leave now dread and servitude 
and run free upon the green grass in the lands of
