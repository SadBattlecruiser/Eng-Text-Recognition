betide
Then Felagund gave the crown of Nargothrond to 
Orodreth his brother to govern in his stead and 
Celegorm and Curufin said nothing but they smiled and 
went from the 
halls
On an evening of autumn Felagund and Beren set out 
from Nargothrond with their ten companions and they 
journeyed beside Narog to his source in the Falls of 
Ivrin Beneath the Shadowy Mountains they came upon a 
company of Orcs and slew them all in their camp by 
night and they took their gear and their weapons By 
the arts of Felagund their own forms and faces were 
changed into the likeness of Orcs and thus disguised 
they came far upon their northward road and ventured 
into the western pass between Ered Wethrin and the 
highlands of TaurnuFuin But Sauron in his tower was 
ware of them and doubt took him for they went in haste 
and stayed not to report their deeds as was commanded 
to all the servants of Morgoth that passed that way 
Therefore he sent to waylay them and bring them before 
him
Thus befell the contest of Sauron and Felagund which 
is renowned For Felagund strove with Sauron in songs
