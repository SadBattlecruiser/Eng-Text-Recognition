flowing
Beside the Sea where the Nolder 
slew
The Foamriders and stealing 
drew
Their white ships with their white 
sails
From lamplit havens The wind 
wails
The wolf howls The ravens 
flee
The ice mutters in the mouths of the 
Sea
The captives sad in Angband 
mourn
Thunder rumbles the fires 
burn
And Finrod fell before the 
throne
Then Sauron stripped from the their disguise and they 
stood before him naked and afraid But though their 
kinds were revealed Sauron could not discover their 
names or their 
purposes
